      The museum was founded in 1857 by French Egyptologist August Mariette
      and moved to its current home — in the distinctive powder-pink mansion
      in Downtown Cairo — in 1897. Yes, the collection is poorly labeled and
      not well set out due to limits of space (and only a fraction of its
      total holdings are actually on display). It also suffers currently with
      some empty cases due to artifacts having been transferred to the GEM,
      but you still can't help being impressed by the sheer majesty of the
      exhibits.
